                    <p>The <b>World Eaters</b> are one of the most infamous and brutal factions in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Known for their relentless pursuit of destruction and combat, they are a Chaos Space Marine Legion dedicated to the Chaos God Khorne, the God of Blood, Skulls, and Murder. Their only purpose is to spill blood in the name of <b>Khorne</b>, seeking to achieve supremacy through unending violence. Their origins are as brutal as their current state, having once been a loyalist Space Marine Legion before falling to the temptations of Chaos during the <b>Horus Heresy</b>.</p>
                    <p>The World Eaters are infamous for their bloodlust and have forsaken all semblance of strategy or subtlety, instead relying on their incredible physical power and sheer brutality to overcome their foes. They are a force of rage, and their combat prowess in close-quarters is unmatched.</p>

                    <h2>The Great Crusade</h2>
                    <p>The World Eaters were originally the War Hounds Legion, a Space Marine Legion created during the Great Crusade by The Emperor of Mankind. They were led by Angron, a powerful Primarch who was known for his uncontrollable rage and thirst for battle. The War Hounds were feared across the galaxy for their incredible fighting ability and savagery. Under Angron's leadership, they would become some of the most feared warriors in the Imperium.</p>
                    <p>However, Angron's fall from grace came when he encountered the Chaos Gods during the Horus Heresy. He was lured to Khorne, the Chaos God of War, Blood, and Murder, who amplified his already unstable temperament and bound him in an eternal state of fury. The War Hounds would become the World Eaters and swear loyalty to Khorne, forsaking their loyalty to the Emperor and the Imperium.</p>
                    <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                    <p>During the Horus Heresy, the World Eaters sided with Horus Lupercal, the Warmaster of Chaos, in his rebellion against the Emperor. Angron and his Legion played a crucial role in the destruction of the loyalist forces. They fought in numerous battles, including the infamous Siege of Terra, where their savagery and bloodlust led them to commit atrocities of unspeakable horror.</p>
                    <p>The World Eaters were the epitome of brutal war and bloodshed. After the Heresy, however, their fall into complete anarchy and madness became apparent. The once-disciplined Legion had lost all semblance of structure and strategy, becoming little more than a roiling mass of berserkers who lived only to shed blood in the name of Khorne.</p>
                    <h2>The Post-Heresy Era</h2>
                    <p>In the current timeline of Warhammer 40,000, the World Eaters are no longer the formidable and organized force they once were. Their Legion is scattered across the galaxy, but each warband shares a common bond: a ceaseless thirst for battle and the spilling of blood. They continue to serve Khorne, but the emphasis is less on military strategy and more on the savage joy of close-quarters combat and the endless slaughter of their enemies.</p>
                    <p>The World Eaters have become synonymous with Berserkers—warriors who fight with rage and abandon, unable to be reasoned with or stopped. They are now a fractured and ferocious force that is more terrifying than ever before, as they are no longer bound by any moral compass, strategy, or control.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The World Eaters, like most Chaos Space Marine Legions, no longer have the rigid structure they once had under the leadership of the Emperor. After the betrayal of Horus and the fall to Chaos, their Legion fractured into various warbands, each led by a Chaos Lord or Daemon Prince who serves the will of Khorne.</p>
                    <p>However, certain elements of their original structure still exist, albeit in a more chaotic and primal form.</p>
                    <h2>Angron, the Red Angel</h2>
                    <p>The Primarch of the World Eaters, Angron, remains their central figure, though his fate is tragic. In the 41st millennium, Angron is a Daemon Prince of Khorne, an unstoppable and monstrous entity. His rage is boundless, and his influence continues to inspire the World Eaters, who view him as their ultimate icon and god. While Angron’s physical presence is rare on the battlefield, his image and presence are ever-powerful, with many World Eaters worshipping his name and serving as his vessels of destruction.</p>
                    <h2>The Eaters of Worlds</h2>
                    <p>The World Eaters do not follow traditional military doctrine. Instead, they organize into bonds of blood, with the most ferocious warriors leading others into battle. These are known as the Eaters of Worlds: powerful leaders who lead by example, charging into the fray with the fury of Khorne at their back. They focus on inflicting damage in hand-to-hand combat, and each warrior aims to claim as many skulls as possible.</p>
                    <h2>The Chain of Command</h2>
                    <p>The World Eaters’ chain of command is more informal than other Chaos Space Marine Legions, with combat effectiveness and strength being the key factors in leadership. These leaders are not above their followers; rather, they are the strongest of the strong, leading by brutal example. Their ranks are filled with berserkers, bloodthirsty warriors who follow their leaders into battle with the singular goal of slaughtering their enemies.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Chaos Lords:</b> The highest-ranking members of a warband, usually seasoned warriors who have earned their place through combat.</li>
                        <li><b>Berserkers:</b> The iconic soldiers of the World Eaters, these warriors are addicted to violence and bloodshed. They are often seen charging into battle with Chainaxes and Chainswords, their rage fueling them in the face of death.</li>
                        <li><b>Possessed:</b> Some World Eaters, after having given themselves fully to Khorne, are transformed into Daemonic entities, known as the Possessed, where they become superhuman killing machines.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The Berzerker Cult</h2>
                    <p>The Berzerkers of Khorne are the most well-known and iconic troops of the World Eaters. These warriors fight in an uncontrollable frenzy, guided only by their fury and the commands of their Chaos Lords. They are equipped with brutal close-combat weapons such as Chainaxes and Chainswords, designed to butcher and maim their enemies in a whirlwind of violence. They wear jagged, spiked armor, and their appearance is a terrifying sight to any who face them.</p>

                    <p>The World Eaters follow a brutal creed, often referred to as the Blood Pact. This pact centers around the following tenets:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Glory in Battle:</b> The World Eaters exist to shed blood and fight. Combat is a sacred duty, and they live only to fight and destroy.</li>
                        <li><b>Rage Unleashed:</b> They believe that only in the heat of battle, when their rage is at its peak, can they achieve true glory in the eyes of Khorne.</li>
                        <li><b>Honor Through Killing:</b> The World Eaters fight for the skulls of their enemies, offering them as trophies to their dark god, Khorne. The more skulls a warrior collects, the higher their status among the World Eaters.</li>
                        <li><b>Endless Slaughter:</b> The World Eaters do not seek to win wars or achieve long-term objectives. They fight to cause endless carnage and destruction, reveling in the annihilation of their enemies.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Strenghts:</h2>
                    <code>Melee Combat Dominance: The World Eaters excel in close-quarters combat, where they are at their most dangerous. Their troops are often faster and more ferocious than their enemies, capable of overwhelming forces with pure brutality.</code>
                    <code>Berserkers: The World Eaters field some of the most dangerous infantry in the game, the Khorne Berzerkers, who are terrifying in close combat and excel at wiping out enemy units in melee.</code>
                    <code>Fearless: Thanks to their devotion to Khorne, World Eaters are often immune to fear, allowing them to fight without hesitation, even in the face of overwhelming odds.</code>
                    <h2>Weaknesses:</h2>
                    <code>Lack of Range: Due to their obsession with close combat, the World Eaters are less effective at ranged combat. They lack long-range firepower compared to other Chaos or Imperial factions.</code>
                    <code>Lack of Strategy: The World Eaters' reliance on unbridled rage and fury leaves them with a lack of tactical flexibility. They charge headlong into battle, and their inability to adapt to changing situations can sometimes be their downfall.</code>
                    <h2>Units and Abilities:</h2>
                    <code>Khorne Berzerkers: The signature unit of the World Eaters, they are frenzied combatants wielding deadly chain weapons.</code>
                    <code>Angron: The Daemon Primarch of Khorne, a terrifying force on the battlefield, leading his World Eaters into the fray.</code>
                    <code>Bloodthirsters: Powerful Greater Daemons of Khorne, often summoned to the battlefield to tear through enemy ranks.</code>

                    <p>The World Eaters are a faction defined by their unyielding bloodlust and devotion to Khorne. Driven by rage and a need for constant battle, they have evolved from a once-loyal Legion into a chaotic and brutal force of Chaos Space Marines. They stand as a living testament to the destructive power of Khorne, and they are a nightmare for any enemy unfortunate enough to cross their path. In Warhammer 40K, they are a force of fury, violence, and bloodshed—one that will never stop, as long as there are skulls to collect.</p>
